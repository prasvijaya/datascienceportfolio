Recently money was withdrawn on a couple of occasions without my permission or consent to pay for a timeshare account that was never used by me nor anyone connected to me because of unfair policies pertaining to the fees of the said timeshare. I tried cancelling the said timeshare account several times because of these fees that were never mentioned at the initiation. My account was debited to pay for the timeshare fees without my knowledge or consent several times. I tried correcting this with Wells Fargo bank with no avail. I would appreciate it if you can look into this matter for me. I was left with no funds in my account and as such I could not take care of the basic necessities of my day to day life. \\nThanks in advance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Because of that, I was carrying an interest bearing balance for the month.

This was surprising, because I have not used this card for a very long time, it has been in my possession but I have not made any charges at all, and the balance has been XXXX for all that time and I have not had any statements mailed out. The statement has two charges of {$3100.00} and {$120.00} which I did not make or recognize. In accordance with procedures, I immediately sent a letter in writing to the bank 's account servicing address stating this - on XX/XX/2020. A copy of the letter is enclosed. As of today, XX/XX/2020 I have no response from the bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

              "27999    Chase Bank filed a frivolous complaint against me ( Michigan XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) after they generated an unethical low-ball appraisal utilizing irrelevant comparable sales, likely done by a person not licensed in the state of Michigan, which is a violation of federal law. I was cleared of any and all wrongdoing by the state of Michigan 's Licensing and Regulatory Authority ( LARA ). \\nUpon being cleared by LARA, Chase refused to accept LARA 's decision and repeatedly denied my appeals to be removed from their banned list, stating that nothing had been resolved. I remained on Chase 's Ineligible Appraiser List for two years after being cleared by LARA. After I submitted a complaint to the FCPB, Chase replied to both the FCPB and me that I had been removed me from their list ( apparently before my complaint, which I was never notified of ) and declared I was on their Eligible Appraisers List ; however, they never sent me another appraisal order, so they either falsely stated I was removed from the ineligible list, or they prevented me from doing appraisals by blacklisting me another way.\\n\\nI would like to obtain the name and license number of their appraiser so I may pursue legal action against him or her, and, if my accusations are found to be valid, I would like your department to investigate and prosecute Chase Bank for knowingly ordering appraisals from unlicensed appraisers, and having them develop appraisals in violation of USPAP. Based on the most recent letter I received from Chase dated XX/XX/2020, they still refer to my appraisal as \" deficient, '' even though I was cleared by the state of Michigan, with LARA stating \" No violation of the Occupational Code, ... Board Rules, .. or Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice '' were present in my appraisal.\n",

              "36174    Exeter Finance has made incorrect reports on the status of my account to the credit bureaus on. On XX/XX/XXXX I received XXXX and XXXX notices that my Exeter account was reported delinquent, when that was incorrect as I set up autopay on my account in XXXX and it was in a current state then. I was notified that my EF account was incorrectly reported 30 days past due on XX/XX/XXXX, not only was it not past due, but the false report caused my credit score to drop by 100 pts, which is unreal. I have not had a missed or late payment on this account and it was very discouraging to have this reported incorrectly and affect my credit in such a way. \\n\\nI have not had such an experience with any other creditor and consider EF as a contributing factor in helping me to improve my credit over the years. Following the this incident, I just went ahead and paid off the {$13000.00} on the loan to be done with them altogether. I tried to file a dispute through the company, but the representatives kept giving me incorrect email addresses to sent my evidence to, all which bounced back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
